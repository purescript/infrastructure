Pursuit

Still need to set up an automated process for:
- database including backups
- nginx config: copy to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
- systemd config: copy to /etc/systemd/system/pursuit.service
- secrets:
  - PURSUIT_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN
  - github deploy key for database backups
  - where to store them? GitHub Actions?
- unattended-upgrades

where should what go?
  - is a single, idempotent, script for both first-time deploy and update
    feasible?
